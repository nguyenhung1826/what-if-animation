description: Make a "What If" animated episode from one topic line ("What if you could rewind 10 seconds?"), in the dusk-lit stick-figure style of the What If channels that broke out on YouTube in October 2026. Writes the script on the seven-beat What If formula, voices it with ElevenLabs, lays out a shot list at the genre's pace, renders a storyboard of stills and self-checks it before animating, animates every frame in code (Remotion and SVG, with an original cast on one rig, rooms in perspective and light from lamps and windows), generates and syncs the sound, and masters a finished 15-25 s episode to -14 LUFS. Use when someone asks for a What If episode, animation or cartoon, "make a what if video about X", a stick-figure explainer in this style, or to run the free What If skill.

# What If animation

One topic line in, a finished 15-25 second episode out. Every frame is SVG that Claude writes (rendered by
Remotion); the voice and the sound come from ElevenLabs. Two examples ship in `studio/src/episodes/`, both ready to
render: `rewind` ("What if you could rewind 10 seconds?", the proof clip: shots played backwards as the power) and
`copy-paste` ("What if you could copy and paste anything?", the skill's first full run: a new kitchen set, a
schematic for the science beat, a cliffhanger blackout). Read the one closest to your topic before you start.

| File | What's in it |
|---|---|
| `studio/CATALOG.md` | **The library: every set, character, prop, look and sound you can reuse. Read it first.** |
| `references/formula.md` | The seven-beat What If formula, the 15-25 s shape, script rules, choosing a topic |
| `references/look.md` | The measured look, pace, shot vocabulary, and the storyboard and motion checklists |
| `references/kit.md` | The building blocks: engine, cast, sets, room kit, light, UI, looks, and how to add each |
| `references/sound.md` | Writing sound events, prompts, levels, costs |
| `references/traps.md` | Everything that cost time on the two example episodes |
| `studio/` | The Remotion project: work in it in place; every episode and every library asset lives in it |
| `scripts/` | voice, plan, stills, board, sfx, mixcheck, motiongrid, master, catalog_check (Python 3.9+ and Node) |

## Rules

- **Library first.** This skill is the channel's own copy (a git repo) and its library grows with every episode.
  Before drawing anything, read `studio/CATALOG.md` and reuse or extend what is there; open `references/kit.md` or an
  asset's file only for the asset you are about to use. Anything new you draw that another episode could use (a
  place, a prop, a character look, a power look) goes into `src/engine/`, gets its row and thumb in `CATALOG.md`, and
  is committed in the same episode (see "Adding to the library" at the end of the catalog). Never leave a reusable
  asset inside an episode's `shots.tsx`.
- **The channel's hero is `LOOKS.hero`** (the `Hero` default): a dark bald round head, cream calm line eyes and slim
  arched brows. Use it as the lead of every new episode. Its outfit changes per episode (see "Costume and face
  options" in `CATALOG.md`); its face never does. Pip stays only in the two shipped examples.
- **Original characters only.** The hero, Pip and Mo are ours, and so are the sister, mum and
  the suit on the rig. Never a channel's own hero (no red hoodie, no white-disc eyes, no star glint in the eye), and nothing that resembles a famous cartoon character: check every
  new look on the cast sheet (Mo's first hat was dropped for drifting toward one).
- **Original stories.** The formula is shared; the episode isn't anyone else's. Don't remake a channel's title.
- **Never claim the viral channels are made with Claude** or any other tool. Nobody has said how they're made.
- **Keys by name only.** `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`, from the environment or a `.env`
  above the studio. Never print, paste or hardcode a key.
- **Report the ElevenLabs credits** of every run: the scripts log them to `out/<slug>/costs.json` and `master.py`
  totals them in `report.json`. The voice's cost is read from the account's history (exact); sound clips don't show
  there, so their cost comes from the account counter, which can lag: re-read it before you report. Say the number
  when you hand the episode over. The copy-paste run cost 152 credits (78 for the voice, 74 for 12 new clips).
- **Storyboard before animation.** No video render until the stills pass the self-check (step 5) and, when the person
  is in the loop, they've seen the board.
- **Every fact is real.** A number in the script is worked out and sourced in the episode's `science` field first.

## Setup (once per machine)

Needs Node 18+, ffmpeg and ffprobe on the PATH, Python 3.9+ with `numpy` and `Pillow`, and an ElevenLabs key.

```bash
cd <skill>/studio && npm install
```

Work **inside `<skill>/studio`**, not in a copy: that folder is in the channel's git repo, so every set, prop and
sound added there is kept, versioned and shared by every later episode. Everything below runs from it; `<skill>`
is this skill's folder. `out/`, `node_modules/` and `.env` are git-ignored. If the person keeps the repo somewhere
other than the skills folder, work in that clone's `studio/` the same way. To work offline or in your own
brand face, put a display font in `public/fonts/` and set `titleFont` in `src/studio.config.ts` (the default title
face, Bricolage Grotesque, and the UI faces load from Google Fonts at render time). To take improvements from the
original skill, merge its `main` into this repo (`git remote add upstream https://github.com/kelano86/what-if-animation`,
`git fetch upstream`, `git merge upstream/main`) and keep this channel's assets and catalog when they conflict.

## The pipeline

Work through the steps in order. Each ends on something you look at before the next.

### 1. Script

Read `references/formula.md`. Search YouTube for the premise first: if a What If channel already has that exact
episode, change the power or the rule. From the topic line, decide the power's word, its rule, three escalating
demos and the turn (one real fact with a number). Write `src/episodes/<slug>/episode.json` with `id` (PascalCase,
the composition name), `slug`, `topic`, `title` (two lines), `script` (one entry per beat) and `science` (each fact:
the claim, the working, the source). 45 to 65 words. Read it aloud at pace: every line must be a picture.

### 2. Voice

```bash
python <skill>/scripts/voice.py <slug>
```

One ElevenLabs take with character timestamps (the 356-character copy-paste take cost 78 credits), then the pauses
cut to the genre's pace: `public/<slug>/voice.wav` and `src/episodes/<slug>/words.json`. Check the length (15-25 s)
and the word times it prints. Retune pauses with `gaps` in `episode.json` and re-run: the take is cached, so that's free. Change a word
and it calls the API again.

### 3. Shot list

Design one shot per picture in the script (usually 9 to 14), varying the size and angle every cut (wide, insert,
medium, close-up, over the shoulder, high, low; see `references/look.md`). Add to `episode.json`:

- `shots`: `{ "id": "S1", "size": "medium", "set": "kitchen", "key": 14, "note": "what we see" }` (`key` is the
  frame of the shot's own clock the storyboard shows)
- `edit`: `{ "shot": "S1", "at": "cookie" }` per cut, cued on the word it lands on (`plan.py` lists the cue forms;
  `reverse`, `from`, `to` and `look` for powers that bend a shot's clock)
- `fx`: one-frame flashes and shakes, `{ "at": "S3+2", "kind": "flash" }`

```bash
python <skill>/scripts/plan.py <slug>
```

It writes `timeline.json` and `out/<slug>/shotlist.md` and prints the pace. Aim for 27+ cuts a minute in the
opening and no static shot over about 3 s; fix what it flags before drawing anything.

### 4. Storyboard

Read `CATALOG.md` and pick the sets, cast, props and looks the shot list needs; open `references/kit.md` only for
the parts you use (coordinates, the room kit). Write `src/episodes/<slug>/shots.tsx`, one component per shot,
each a pure function of its clock `t` (copy the patterns in the two examples' `shots.tsx`), and `index.tsx` (the
episode and its power look), then add the episode to `src/episodes/index.ts`. At this step each shot only needs to
be right at its `key` frame. When a topic needs something the catalog lacks, first see whether an existing asset can take a new prop (a `night`
kitchen, a `broken` phone); only if not, build a new one in `src/engine/` (places with the room kit in
`src/engine/sets/`), as the copy-paste run did with the kitchen and the schematic. Then follow "Adding to the
library" in `CATALOG.md`: its row, its thumb, the check. A new character or costume: add the look, check it on the
cast sheet (`npx remotion still src/index.ts Cast out/cast.png`), and catalogue it.

```bash
npx tsc --noEmit
node <skill>/scripts/stills.mjs <slug>
python <skill>/scripts/board.py <slug>
```

`out/<slug>/storyboard.jpg`: one captioned still per shot.

### 5. Self-check the stills

Look at the storyboard, then open every still in `out/<slug>/board/` at full size, and run the storyboard checklist
in `references/look.md` honestly, shot by shot. Write down what fails, fix it, re-render just those shots
(`stills.mjs <slug> S3 S7`), rebuild the sheet and look again. Repeat until it passes. Check `references/traps.md`
for the failure you're seeing before inventing a fix. If the person is in the loop, show them the board now and
take their notes before animating.

### 6. Animate

Bring each shot to life from its key pose: `poseAt` keys with anticipation, holds and overshoot, `faceAt` for
expressions, camera moves with `kf`, the power's look, the `fx`. Then render a draft and check the motion:

```bash
python <skill>/scripts/master.py <slug>
python <skill>/scripts/motiongrid.py <slug> S2 S5
node <skill>/scripts/stills.mjs <slug> --frames 120 240
```

Read the grids like a flipbook against the motion checklist in `references/look.md`; fix and re-render until it
reads.

### 7. Sound

Read `references/sound.md`. Add `sound` to `episode.json`: the clips (prompt and length), one event per visible
action cued to its shot, ambiences per location, the music bed and the levels. Check what the library already has
(the Sound table in `CATALOG.md`, and `library/sfx/`) and reuse a clip by name before writing a new prompt, then
generate:

```bash
python <skill>/scripts/sfx.py <slug> --dry
python <skill>/scripts/sfx.py <slug>
```

It prints the credits it used and sets the stem volumes in `timeline.json`. Then check that every word stays clear:

```bash
python <skill>/scripts/mixcheck.py <slug>
```

It lists the moments, while a word is being spoken, where effects or music come within 3 dB of the voice. A hit that
illustrates a word lands in the pause just after it, never on it; a bed (a hum, a drone) under a key line comes down;
if most of the stem crowds the voice, lower `sfx_lu`. Re-run sfx.py and the check until only deliberate overlaps
remain (a title boom, a turn).

### 8. Master and hand over

```bash
python <skill>/scripts/master.py <slug>
```

Renders, brings the mix to -14 LUFS with peaks under -1 dBTP, and writes `out/<slug>/report.json` (length, loudness,
pace, credits). Watch the final file once through with sound. Then close the library: add any new clips to the Sound table in
`CATALOG.md`, run `python <skill>/scripts/catalog_check.py` until it reports nothing missing, and commit and push
(`git add -A && git commit -m "episode: <slug>" && git push`; the episode's own files go in too, as reference for
later episodes). Hand over `out/<slug>/<slug>-final.mp4` and
`out/<slug>/storyboard.jpg`, with the length, the ElevenLabs credits used, what was added to the library, and anything you'd still improve.

## Where an episode lives

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `src/episodes/<slug>/episode.json` | Everything you write: script, science, shots, edit, fx, sound |
| `src/episodes/<slug>/shots.tsx`, `index.tsx` | The drawing: one component per shot, the power's look |
| `src/episodes/<slug>/words.json`, `timeline.json` | Written by voice.py and plan.py (sfx.py adds the volumes) |
| `public/<slug>/` | voice.wav, sfx.wav, music.wav |
| `out/<slug>/` | board stills, storyboard.jpg, shotlist.md, motion grids, renders, costs.json, report.json |
| `library/sfx/` | Every generated sound clip, shared by all episodes |
| `library/thumbs/` | One still per catalogued asset, named in `CATALOG.md` |
| `CATALOG.md` | The index of everything above that later episodes can reuse |
